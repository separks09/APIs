    "The largest hurdle to using random latitiudes and longitudes to call on OpenWeatherMap I could see is that 71% of the earth is water.  Any lat/long that fell into these areas too far from the shore was likely to be returned by OpenWeatherMap as \"not found\".  By using CitiPy first, you can map the coordinates that fall into the ocean to the nearest city on land.  You might still get some cities that are \"not found\" on OpenWeatherMap, as well as duplicate cities (most likely due to being the closest city on land to two different sets of coordinates over the ocean).  But overall passing coordinates through CitiPy gives you cleaner data to pass on to OpenWeatherMap.  But do CitiPy's methods of locating the closest city keep the cities spread out over the world?\n",
